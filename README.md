# RemoteUploader

This PHP-based tool is designed to download files from a different server to your server. It reduces the time you need to spend for uploading larger files to your web server.
	
You don't have to follow the DownloadFromWebsite-StoreInYourDevice-UploadToYourWebsite procedure since this tool can perform the task with a single step (i.e. to download the file automatically to your website).

# ******* How to Use? *******
You just have to upload the PHP file (remote.php) in your website and open it in a browser tab where you will be presented with a page including a text box along with "Start Uploading!" button.

You need to enter the URL of the file you'd like to upload to your website in the text box and press the button to start uploading.

Until the file is uploaded, you need to keep the webpage open.
